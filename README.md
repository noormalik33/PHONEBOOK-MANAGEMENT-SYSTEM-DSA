# 📞 PHONEBOOK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DSA)

A console-based Phonebook Management System developed in C++ using core data structures like linked lists and stacks. The application simulates a contact manager where users can store, delete, and view contact information. It also tracks recent calls, suggests contact names, and mimics real-world phone functionalities using DSA concepts.

A command-line Phonebook application developed in C++ using **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts. This system demonstrates the use of **linked lists** for dynamic contact storage and **stacks** for tracking recent calls. It supports creating, deleting, displaying, and recommending contacts.

## 🛠 Features

- ➕ Add new contact with multiple phone numbers
- 📃 Display all saved contacts
- ❌ Delete a contact by name
- 📞 Make a phone call simulation
- 🕓 View recently dialed contacts (using stack)
- 🤖 Recommend contacts based on prefix search

## 💡 Concepts Used

- **Linked Lists** for managing contacts and their phone numbers
- **Stacks** for implementing recently dialed contact tracking
- **Pointers** for dynamic memory allocation
- **Object-Oriented Programming** structure

## 🧪 Functional Details

- **Structs** used for representing phone numbers and contacts
- **Classes** encapsulate contact management and stack logic
- Memory is manually managed using destructors (`~list`, `~Stack`)
- Modular design with multiple operations and user-friendly interface

## 🔧 Technologies

- **Language:** C++
- **Concepts:** OOP, Linked List, Stack, Pointers, Dynamic Memory
- **Tools:** Any C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
